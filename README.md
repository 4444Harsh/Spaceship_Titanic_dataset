# Spaceship Titanic - Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting which passengers survived the Titanic spaceship disaster using logistic regression.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use the **Spaceship Titanic** dataset to predict the survival of passengers. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and other attributes of the passengers. 

Logistic regression is employed as the primary algorithm for classification, and the results are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger.
- **HomePlanet**: The planet the passenger departed from.
- **CryoSleep**: Whether the passenger elected to be put in cryosleep.
- **Cabin**: The passenger's cabin.
- **Destination**: The destination of the passenger.
- **Age**: The passenger's age.
- **VIP**: Whether the passenger paid for special VIP service.
- **RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck**: Amounts the passenger has spent on these amenities.
- **Transported**: Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension (the target variable).

## Model

The model used is **Logistic Regression**, a common algorithm for binary classification tasks. 

### Steps Included:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handling missing values.
    - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, embarked).
    - Standardization of numerical features.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.
    - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (if applicable).

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Accuracy score.
    - Confusion matrix visualization.
    - Precision, Recall, and F1-score (optional).
    
## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spaceship-titanic-logistic-regression.git
   cd spaceship-titanic-logistic-regression
   ```

2. **Install the Required Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file (if available):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch the notebook to execute the model training and evaluation:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spaceship_titanic_logistic_regression.ipynb
   ```

4. **Train and Evaluate the Model**:
   Execute the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, and evaluate the results.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The final model achieved an accuracy score of XX% on the test set.
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix shows the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Other Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-score (if applicable).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

To install the dependencies, use the following:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Conclusion

Logistic regression proved to be an effective model for classifying whether passengers were transported to another dimension based on the given features. Further improvement could be achieved by experimenting with different algorithms and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
